        Colours in UI design can speak in ways that are every bit as powerful as copy. They not only affect how your design looks, but can go as far as to elicit emotion and reflect the personality of your brand.

        While Colour can be subjective, it's clear that good Colours
        can attract and convert users. Bad Colours, on the other
        hand, can turn away users and even make designs inaccessible
        and unusable.
